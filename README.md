# Global-Greenery-Metrics-Analyzing-Environmental-Data-for-Countries-and-Regions
Analyzing environmental data related to land area and forest area across different countries and regions

## Introduction
The greenery dataset was provided with three(3) files which represented our tables. We have Regions, land area, and forest area which can be seen under the names **forest area.csv**, **land area.csv** and **regions.csv** in the file section and I performed data analysis using SQL. The dataset contains information about various countries, country codes, regions, forest square kilometres, total area square miles, year and income group details.

## Problem Statement
I wanted to find a way to understand the environment and things that affect it like deforestation, countries with large forests and the total area of countries. 
The following questions were asked and the answers were provided to questions and problems below.

1. Find the total number of countries involved in deforestation.
2. Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000?
3. Retrieve the names of countries that have a forest area (in square kilometres) greater than the average forest area of all countries in the "High Income" income group.
4. Calculate the average total area (in square miles) for countries in the "Upper Middle Income" income group? Compare the result with the rest of the income categories.
Hint: calculate the average total areas for the 3 other categories.
5. Determine the total forest area (in square kilometres) for countries in the "High Income" income group? Also, compare with the other income categories.
6. What are the countries from each region or continent having the highest total forest area?
